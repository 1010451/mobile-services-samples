# [GettingStartedWithPush](./android)

This is the latest version of the **Add push notifications to your Mobile Services app**, using the Mobile Services SDK 2.0. Currently the sample available is for the Android platform. The **Android** folder contains one that uses the Eclipse IDE. The one in the **AndroidStudio** folder uses the Android Studio IDE.

This app is the result of completing the [Add push notifications to your Mobile Services app](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-javascript-backend-android-get-started-push/) tutorial. The only difference is that the downloaded version has the mobile service url and credentials filled in, whereas this version contains placeholders.

This app may be useful for you if you want to see the completed code, or want code that you can try running.
Note that to run it you must have a mobile service that is set up appropriately.
