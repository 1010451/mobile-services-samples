# Mobile Services Samples 

##[TodoListNotifications (PhoneGap)](./TodoListNotifications/readme.md) 
PhoneGap is a free and open source framework, which makes it easier to create app for key mobile device platforms using standardized web APIs, HTML and JavaScript. This sample shows how to use Azure Mobile Services (JavaScript backend) integrated with Azure Notification Hubs to send push notifications to a PhoneGap app on three client platforms: iOS, Android, and Windows Phone 8. This sample adds push notifications, using Notification Hubs, to the [PhoneGap quickstart project](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-javascript-backend-phonegap-get-started/) for Mobile Services. The sample uses the PhoneGap [PushPlugin](https://github.com/phonegap-build/PushPlugin) and Mobile Services REST APIs to create push notification registrations in the Notification Hubs. For more information, see the [sample readme file](./TodoListNotifications/readme.md).

##[TicTacToe](./TicTacToe)
TicTacToe is a Windows 8.1 app that uses a mobile services backend to enable multiple players to play tic-tac-toe games with each other on their Windows 8.1 devices. The sample demonstrates the same mobile service with the JavaScript and .NET backends, with the same client. The sample shows how to use table scripts (table controllers in the .NET backend), user authentication with Microsoft Accounts, push notifications using notification hubs and tags, custom APIs, and the .NET client API. See the [sample readme file](./TicTacToe/readme.md).
